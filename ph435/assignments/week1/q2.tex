\question*{Optimize the layout of the circuit on a 2D silicon 
wafer to minimize the surface area. The smaller the 2-D surface 
area, the lesser the probability of the circuit being hit by a 
cosmic ray particle.

Use the basic source-gate-drain structure of a 
MOSFET as discussed in class. \hfill \textbf{[70]}}
