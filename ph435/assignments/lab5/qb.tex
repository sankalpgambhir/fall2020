\question*{
    Double speedmeter that also measures phase
}

Code uploaded is in the appendix. I measured the time difference between the two
outputs from the square wave generator, flipped version of each other. The time
difference observed, \textbf{$740 \mu s$} is in agreement with the expected
value of $757 \mu s$ as per the observed frequency in Part 2.

The state diagram is as follows

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[state] (q1) {\texttt{diff = } $\downarrow$};
      \node[state] at (6,0) (q2) {\texttt{diff = } $\uparrow$};

      \draw (q1) edge[loop left]        node{$1 \uparrow $} (q1)
            (q1) edge[bend left, above] node{$0 \uparrow$}  (q2)
            (q2) edge[bend left, below] node{$1 \uparrow$}  (q1)
            (q2) edge[loop right]        node{$0 \uparrow $} (q2);
  \end{tikzpicture}
