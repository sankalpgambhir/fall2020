\textbf{DAC}

The code uploaded to the Arduino for testing the DAC alone. Delays were introduced
manually to see the changes in the output clearly. It can also be seen without the delay,
by keeping the print there, but this is just clearer.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void setup(){
    Serial.begin(1000000); // why not
    for(int i = 2; i < 6; i++){
        pinMode(i, OUTPUT);
    }
}

void loop(){
    for(int i = 2; i < 5; i++){
        digitalWrite(i, HIGH);
        delay(500); // manually add delay
        Serial.println(5 * (analogRead() / 1023.0)); // measured Vout in Volts
    }
}
    
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{VCCS}
\label{appendix:arduino}

The code uploaded to the Arduino for testing the DAC and the VCCS. We iterate 
from a value corresponding to a value below threshold to one well above it, while
making sure to not modify \texttt{Rx/Tx} pins (0 and 1).
