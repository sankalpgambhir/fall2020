\question

I used the following code to encode the system

\lstinputlisting[language=VHDL]{code/q6.smv}

And received the following output from simulation (the specification was added after simulation)

\begin{verbatim}
    â–² assignments/as1/code NuSMV -int q6.smv
    ... LICENSE TRIMMED
    
    NuSMV > go
    NuSMV > pick_state -r
    NuSMV > print_current_state -v
    Current state is 1.1
    m0.state = off
    m1.state = off
    NuSMV > simulate -r -k 5
    ********  Simulation Starting From State 1.1   ********
    NuSMV > show_traces -t
    There is 1 trace currently available.
    NuSMV > show_traces -v

        m0.state = off
        m1.state = off
        m0.out = FALSE
        m1.out = FALSE
      -> State: 1.2 <-
        m0.state = on
        m1.state = off
        m0.out = TRUE
        m1.out = FALSE
      -> State: 1.3 <-
        m0.state = off
        m1.state = on
        m0.out = FALSE
        m1.out = TRUE
      -> State: 1.4 <-
        m0.state = on
        m1.state = on
        m0.out = TRUE
        m1.out = TRUE
      -> State: 1.5 <-
        m0.state = off
        m1.state = off
        m0.out = FALSE
        m1.out = FALSE
      -> State: 1.6 <-
        m0.state = on
        m1.state = off
        m0.out = TRUE

\end{verbatim}

The required property holds, as checked in another run of the same program in
batch mode.

\begin{lstlisting}
    SPEC
    AG (m0.out <-> AX (! m0.out))
\end{lstlisting}
