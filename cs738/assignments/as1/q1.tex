    \questionpart The formulae would be classified as

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\globally \finally (p \land \lnot \lnext p)$ --- \textbf{(A)} It
                is a well formed LTL over an infinite word, or path in a
                computation tree, however, due to the use of $\globally,
                \finally, \lnext$ free of state qualifier $\always$ wouuld make
                this (D), not a well formed formula if considered over a
                transition system (i.e. well formed per the usual LTL grammar,
                but not well formed as a subset of CTL$^*$)

        \item $\always \lnot \globally \lnot p$ --- \textbf{(C)}
         
        \item $\always \eventually \finally r$ --- \textbf{(C)} I am unsure
            about $\always$ and $\eventually$ occuring together but the grammar
            seems to allow it. In its current form it is not a valid CTL formula,
            however, $\always\eventually$ is functionally equivalent to $\always$ so
            it is equivalent to a CTL formula, same as the previous part.

        \item $\finally(p \Rightarrow \globally  r) \lor (\lnot q) \until p$ ---
                \textbf{(A)} Could also be (D), same argument as 1.

        \item $\always (\eventually (p \until r) \lor \lnext q)$ --- \textbf{(C)} Use of
                Next without attached state qualifier.
    \end{enumerate}

    \questionpart The formula is $\always\globally (p \Rightarrow \always \lnext
    \eventually[q\until r])$. Its parse tree is

            [$\always$
                [$\globally$

    \questionpart The formula is $\always (p \until \eventually\finally r)$. Its
    parse tree (in CTL) is
