    Prove that the LTL formulae $\finally \phi$ and $\lnot \globally (\lnot \phi)$
    are equivalent.
}

Let $\model = (S, R, S_0, L)$ be an arbitrary model, and 
$\treepath \in \paths{\model}{s}$ an arbitrary path with $s \in S_0$.
We prove that $\finally \phi$ holds iff $\lnot \globally (\lnot \phi)$ does.

\emph{($\Rightarrow$ direction).} If $\model, \treepath \models \finally \phi$,
there exists an $i \in \naturals$ such that $\model, \treepath^i \models \phi$
per the definition of the operator $\finally$. Consider now the formula
$\globally (\lnot \phi)$ --- the semantics of the operator $\globally$ imply that
for this formula to hold, $\forall j \in \naturals : \model, \treepath^j \models
\lnot \phi$, but we know that this does not hold for $j = i$, as 
$\model, \treepath^k \models \lnot \phi$ iff $\model, \treepath^k \not \models \phi$
for any $k$, as per the definition of $\lnot$. Thus, 
$\model, \treepath \not \models \globally(\lnot \phi)$ and by extension
$\model, \treepath \models \lnot \globally(\lnot \phi)$.

\emph{($\Leftarrow$ direction).} If $\model, \treepath \models \lnot \globally (\lnot \phi)$,
then, reducing using the definition of the operator $\lnot$, 
$\model, \treepath \not \models \globally (\lnot \phi)$. Negating the definition
of the operator $\globally$, we see that there must exist an $i \in \naturals$
such that the subformula does not hold, that is, $\model, \treepath^i \models \lnot \lnot \phi$.
Reducing this using the double negation axiom, we get that $\model, \treepath^i \models \phi$.
This is precisely the condition for $\finally \phi$ to hold. So we get that
$\model, \treepath \models \finally \phi$.

Thus, the two formulae imply each other and are thus equivalent for the pair
$\tuple{\model, \treepath}$. But, since both were chosen arbitrarily from the
respective domains, the equivalence holds true for all $\tuple{\model, \treepath}$.
Thus, the two formulae are equivalent.
