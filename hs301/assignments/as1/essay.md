## Nature of philosophy

### Sankalp

Having been self-taught, Heraclitus' philosophy was often in stark 
contrast with his contemporaries. A philosophy born out of
introspection more so than argument, it offers a uniquely human 
insight of Greece's society and of nature itself. Many of his ideas,
born out of criticism of his contemporaries' practices and 
lives, offer a theory of contradictions built upon contradictions.
He utilises vague language to make his own work precarious to 
navigate and understand, in belief that his knowledge is only
accessible to those who attempt to experience it, a possible reason 
for his works not being proliferated as well as of those he criticized,
little remaining of what he wrote. This way, he emphasizes the
blindness of humans not only in his work, but his legacy too.
His ideas constantly revile the masses and their following of 
philosophers and poets, drawing comparisons to mindless cults, arguing
for people to seek their own understanding of the timeless truth, the
*logos*, instead paints futile following of troubadours trotting in careless
collection of thought, only to live in a brittle bubble of obtuse opinion.

- Fire, the fundamental substance
  - Philosophers criticize that he chose the most transient element.

    > Fire as the fundamental object represents change.\
    > Change is the only unchanging object in the world.
