# Heraclitus

## Introduction

Heraclitus is a polarizing figure in the history of philosophy. Little survives of his work save fragments and hearsay in works of other philosophers. Little of what is told about his life, such as his birth around 500 BCE is known are proven to be true and most accounts are believed to be fictionalized stories. [Diogenes Laertius 9.1â€“17]. However several partss of his philosophy were groundbreaking at that time and can find parallels in several modern thoughts and philosophies making a study of his work very interesting.  
 In order to truly appreciate his work one must understand the society and culture that he operated in. Heraclitus was deeply contempous both of his intellectual contemporaries such as Pythagoras as well the rest of society, who he felt were too opinionated and passed off poetry from the homeric tradition as wisdom.  It is in this context that his philosophy gains greater significance than is immedietly obvious. Greek society at that time was in a deep philosphical conflict over the nature of the best possible life, the quality of 'aerte' that is different in the Illiad, with Achilles and The Odyssey with Odessues. \. This is where his unification of contradictions attempts to reconcile those differences and provides a new frame to obtain value through a cosmic justice become significant [1]
