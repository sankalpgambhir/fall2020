# Heraclitus

## Introduction

Heraclitus is a polarizing figure in the history of philosophy. Little survives of his work save fragments and hearsay in works of other philosophers. Little of what is told about his life, such as his birth around 500 BCE is known are proven to be true and most accounts are believed to be fictionalized stories. [Diogenes Laertius 9.1â€“17]. However several partss of his philosophy were groundbreaking at that time and can find parallels in several modern thoughts and philosophies making a study of his work very interesting.  
 In order to truly appreciate his work one must understand the society and culture that he operated in. Heraclitus was deeply contempous both of his intellectual contemporaries such as Pythagoras as well the rest of society, who he felt were too opinionated and passed off poetry from the homeric tradition as wisdom.  It is in this context that his philosophy gains greater significance than is immedietly obvious. Greek society at that time was in a deep philosphical conflict over the nature of the best possible life, the quality of 'aerte' that is different in the Illiad, with Achilles and The Odyssey with Odessues. \. This is where his unification of contradictions attempts to reconcile those differences and provides a new frame to obtain value through a cosmic justice become significant [1] 

## Nature of philosophy

Having been self-taught, Heraclitus' philosophy was often in stark 
contrast with his contemporaries. A philosophy born out of
introspection more so than argument, it offers a uniquely human 
insight of Greece's society and of nature itself. Many of his ideas,
born out of criticism of his contemporaries' practices and 
lives, offer a theory of contradictions built upon contradictions.
He utilises vague language to make his own work precarious to 
navigate and understand, in belief that his knowledge is only
accessible to those who attempt to experience it, a possible reason 
for his works not being proliferated as well as of those he criticized,
little remaining of what he wrote. This way, he emphasizes the
blindness of humans not only in his work, but his legacy too.
His ideas constantly revile the masses and their following of 
philosophers and poets, drawing comparisons to mindless cults, arguing
for people to seek their own understanding of the timeless truth, the
*logos*, instead paints futile following of troubadours trotting in careless
collection of thought, only to live in a brittle bubble of obtuse opinion.


- Humanist ideas
  - Arguing about philosophy as some certain truth, obtainable only as experiences of humans.
- Unity of contradictions

- Fire, the fundamental substance
  - Philosophers criticize that he chose the most transient element.
  - Alternate thought: 
    > Fire as the fundamental object represents change.\
    > Change is the only unchanging object in the world.
- Flux <- as an example of contradictions

## Epistemiology
Heraclitus values subjective truths brought out by one's own experiences over the hearsay and teachings that have been handend down by others, claiming that he would rather trust his eyes than ears. [Fragment55,101a,107,19]. The emphasis on subjective experience and inquiry is further stenghtend in fragment 28 "I went in search of myself". He claims that true wisdom is mysterious, both hard to grasp but easy and self evident at the same time. The most important contribution of Hercalitus here is his claim that human order and human value arises as a consequence of some cosmic order and justice[Fragment30]. This leads us into the main idea of his epistemology, the unity of paradoxes. While there was significant debate in greek society about the nature of value and 'aerte' He argues that the only wisdom is one which is aligned with the cosmic justice and social order [Fragement30]. This is exemplified also by his dual use of the word 'logos' both to represent human order and logic and the cosmic order. This idea of unifying contradictions [Fragment10] is also seen through multiple examples, like his claim that night and day are but the same, that Saltwater is poisonous to us but integral for fish, that war is Justice for that is the only way peace has value [Fragment82] claiming that they too are not different but the  Thus Heraclitus implores us to deeply reflect upon our lives and expereiences to try and obtain true wisdom beyond apparent contradictions
