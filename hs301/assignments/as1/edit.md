# Heraclitus

Heraclitus is a polarizing figure in the history of philosophy. Little survives of his work save fragments and hearsay. Several parts of his philosophy were groundbreaking at the time and can find parallels in  modern thought and philosophy, arguing
for people to seek their own understanding of the timeless truth, the *logos*. 
In order to truly appreciate his work one must understand the society and culture that he operated in. Heraclitus was deeply contemptuous both of his intellectual contemporaries such as Pythagoras as well the rest of society, who he felt were too opinionated and passed off poetry from the homeric tradition as wisdom, drawing comparisons to mindless cults. It is in this context that his philosophy gains greater significance. Greek society at that time was in a deep philosphical conflict over the nature of the best possible life, the quality of 'aerte' that is different in the Illiad, and the Odyssey [1]
This is where his unification of contradictions attempts to reconcile those differences and provides a new understanding of value through a cosmic justice [1].

Having been self-taught, Heraclitus' philosophy was often in stark 
contrast with his contemporaries. A philosophy born out of
introspection more so than argument, it offers a uniquely human 
insight of Greece's society and of nature itself. Many of his ideas,
born out of criticism of his contemporaries' practices and 
lives, offer a theory of contradictions built upon contradictions.
He utilises vague language to make his own work precarious to 
navigate and understand, in belief that his knowledge is only
accessible to those who attempt to experience it, a possible reason 
for his works not being proliferated widely,
little remaining of what he wrote. 

Heraclitus may be considered a material monist, though his view on
the matter seem contradictory, possible intentionally.
Use of vague language lands his words to many interpretations, but a 
common theme we can deduce is that of change. Change is the only thing
that carries permanence. Everything changes with time, and change is 
unending. This is made clear through his analogy of the river [Fragments50,51] He aptly represents change with fire and its transience, starkened against the use
of the other common elements by his contemporaries in theories of monism,
for their permanent natures.

Heraclitus values subjective truths brought out by one's own experiences over the hearsay and teachings that have been handed down by others, claiming that he would rather trust his eyes than ears. [Fragment55,101a,107,19]. The emphasis on subjective experience and inquiry is further stenghtend in fragment 28 "I went in search of myself". He claims that true wisdom is mysterious, both hard to grasp but easy and self evident at the same time. His most important epistemoligical contribution is his claim that human order and human value arises as a consequence of some cosmic order and justice[Fragment30]. This leads us into the main premise oh his ideas, the unity of paradoxes. 
While there was significant debate in greek society about the nature of value and 'aerte' He argues that the only wisdom is one which is aligned with the cosmic justice and social order [Fragement30]. This is exemplified also by his dual use of the word 'logos' both to represent human order and logic and the cosmic order. This idea of unifying contradictions [Fragment10] is also seen through multiple examples, like his claim that night and day are but the same, that Saltwater is poisonous to us but integral for fish, that war is justice for that is the only way peace has value [Fragment82], that there is duality in life and death[Fragment93] claiming that they too are not different but the  Thus Heraclitus implores us to deeply reflect upon our lives and expereiences to try and obtain true wisdom beyond apparent contradictions.
