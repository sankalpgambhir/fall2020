## Buddhism WHatever 

### History 

For centuries, Buddhism remained isolated to East Asia, and while branches of it
emerged, influenced by different philosophies, cultural influence would remain
limited till it did not escape its confines. However, the 20th and 21st century, recovering from the horrors of the world wars brought with it a new spiritual desire across the world for a philosophy of peace and acceptence that was more rational and relevent than Christianity in a world of science. It was Buddhism that filled this gap, gaining huge prominence across the world. This movement was led by many different masters across sects, like the Vipassana movement in India, Thich Nhat Than's zen and Mahayana teachings and even western masters like Bernie Glassman. While their methodologies may be very different, they are united with thier unwavering focus on overcoming the suffering of all sentient beings, at a personal, spiritual,societal and environmental level. 


### Society 
Unlike the misconsception that buddhism seeks to detach itself from all wordly matters, Buddhism has been engaged politically and economically. This can be justified through the Madhyapratipat. The suffering of poverty and hunger, of the violence many face on a day to day basis is terrible, and instead of passively accepting this suffering, Buddhism argues that we must seek too reduce it. Some authors like Thich Nhat Than explicitly interpret the 1st precept, take no life, as a call to actively help others overcome their suffering. The teachings of annata, or no self, and the pratityasamutapadda together cultivate a compassionate, nonjudgemental attitude that emphasises our interconnectedness. This allows us to combat three social ills. The first, poverty throughout the world. By avoiding the rampant, toxic consumerism of the western world and developing compassion for all those suffering, we are better able to use our resources to aid those suffering instead of wasting it on making better cars. The second is the violence seen across the world, such as the conflict in Isarel and Palestine. By developing compassion and a nonjudgemental attitude towards even our adversries, we are able to break the cycle of seeking revenge and move towards reconciliation and healing. This also allows us to develop communal harmony in places with ethnic conflict, as was seen by the emphasis on communal living by Sarvodaya in Sri Lanka. Finally, by realising the interconnectedness we have with the environment, we may spur collective action to stop the environmental degradation that is coming as a consequence of the unchecked consumption we have today.

-  Developed in the 20th century across several buddhist asian countries. Eg:
   Plum Village tradition of Thich Nhat Than (Vietnam -> France),  Sarvodaya
   Shramadana (Sri Lanka), 14th Dalai Lama (Tibet -> Dharmashala) as well as by
   Western Masters (Bernie Glassman). 
-  Inspired by the crises in the 20th century (WW2, Cold War,  Vietnam War etc),
   ecological crises (eg Fishing in Thailand)
-  Influenced by some western ideas like psychology, economics etc. 
-  Development monks in Thailand, Ecology monks etc
-  Not true that Buddhism is very isolationist and inward driven. Bhikkus play
   role in society that was lost by colonialism. The Buddha gained enlightenment
   but also taught and helped those suffering. 
```
The Buddhe proposed Madhyapratipat, the middle path, for the one and the many. A
consequence was an economy of moderation and interdependence, to help oneself
and others, to eliminate poverty, which in itself is a terrible form of
suffering, which makes one's self worth dependent only on the monetary value of
their possessions. By encouraging satisfaction of interdependent needs, Buddhism
promotes a serene and symbiotic way of life for the one and their society. The
5th precept may be understood as avoiding consumerism of things toxic to
oneself, and to focus on your own betterment. In recent times, with ever
increasing wealth gaps, Buddhism offers a path to a harmonious society free of
toxic segregation by perceived worth.

```
## Economics 
- Buddha proposed the Madhyapratipat - or the middle way. He did not endorse
  poverty. 
- Poverty is a terrible form of suffering, that should not be allowed to exist. 
- Engaged buddhism believes in humanistic socialism. This has led to a great
  amount of consumption that is bad for the world. People feel like their value
  is only dependent on the cost of the things they own. Dukkha leads to this
  desire that cannot be quenched. Focus should be on taking care of the
  interdependent needs (The Right Livelihood )
- Thailand monks preach against consumerism to people who have taken on huge
  debts. 
- You can interpret the 5th precept to avoid consumerism of things that are
  toxic to you. Unending growth is unsustainable. Desires are the root of dukkha
  and so feeding those desires will still lead to more dukkha. 
- Focus is on becoming something better. Based on annata, you are not who you
  are but what you can become. The focus therefore is on improving youself
  always. 
- Buddhist notion of interdependence is used to justify building interdependent
  communities with harmony. Focus is given on incorporating multicultural focus
  on the varioud ethnicities in Sarvoday. 
- Shared, communal meals etc. 
```
**TODO translate ecology**

```
## Ecology 
- Caring for the environment important par of engaged buddhism - Eg protesting
  against nuclear development and waste dumping in tibet. 
- Interdependence / Pratityasamuttapada is used to show how we are connected to
  ecology and the environment. Existence is a web of connectedness. 
- Buddhism seems the environemnt as having value to humans as well as intrinsic
  values thorugh annata. Animans are sentient beings. We should try and stop
  their suffering 
- Deep ecology - inspired by Spinoza, Gandhi and Buddhism. Let go of
  anthropomorphism 
- Mindfullness helps connect with nature, to realise annata. 
- Inspired rainforest action network in the USA by realizing that there is no
  separation between the rainforest and him. 
- Ability to come out of despair. Acknowledge that it is real, and participate
  in the world's pain. 
- Thailands ecology monks, focus on deforestation. Ordain trees in forests as
  monks to prevent people from cutting it down . 
- Don't treat corporates as evil, try to work with them.

### Personal 

The second, its adaptability. Buddhism at its core is more minimal than a
religion, less weighted. The crux of the Buddha's teachings, in the noble eight fold path, provide a minimal set of guidelines without elaborate rituals that allows us to walk towards satisfaction and happiness. The notion of no-self or anatta is sometimes misunderstood as a complete detachment of self. Several modern interpretations, however choose to emphasize the interconnectedness of the self, society and environnment. This is aided by the practice of Metta and Karuna, creating a sense of goodwill and compassion for the whole world. This allows people, stuck in the suffering of their day to day lives find new sources of gratitude and peace beyond the narrow identity based on consumerism pushed by modern capitalist society.. Empirical studies have also shown that the emphasis on right consumption and mindfullness significantly improve people's mental health, therby becoming important aids to psychiatry. Further, the nonjugdemental and accepting nature of buddhism have made it a refuge for marginalized groups, with offshoots like gay buddhism and feminist buddhism. The idea of no-self means that the emphasis isn't on who you are, but what you can become, thereby providing hope and opportunity for reform, overcoming past wrongdoing and trauma. Therefore, Buddhism is a powerful tool for enriching personal lives in the modern day. 

 It is a way of life. A set of guidelines, a path to
be walked on to satisfaction and happiness, with an interpretation of its
destination. Political and social issues in the 20th century synergized with
this adaptability to form many branches of Buddhism; to each his own path to
happiness. Several minor branches such as feminist Buddhism and Gay Buddhism
have been noted, springing up alongside the respective social movements.
