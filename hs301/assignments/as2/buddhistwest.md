# Early contact

Buddhism made contact with the European Christian community in the 19th century,
then dismissed by most religious figures as an "idolatric produce of Indian
pessimism". However, the viewpoint did not remain unchallenged for long, as with
the rise of Buddhist depictions in literature brought the judgement to the hands
of the common people, with them suffering in the most brutal wars yet seen.
Riding on the wind of rising spiritualism, it established itself as a less
radical, more rational alternative to Christianity in most minds. 

At the same time, a rise in Darwinistic philosophy and a stronger belief in
science among people was loosening faith in Christianity, while many scholars
argued for Buddhism as a more consistent philosophy, encouraging reason and
observation more so than faith.

# Rise in the west

Buddhism has taken hold in western countries much faster than other religions in
the past, most probably due to it resonating more so than ever with calls for
peace as well as the green movement.

Two possible reasons for its fiery spread can be speculated, its detachment from
the relatively isolated asian culture, and its adaptability. 

- The first, arising from the Dalai Lama's exit due to Tibet's political
  situation, put Buddhism front and center on the world stage, giving many the
  insight and opportunity needed to delve in it, coupled with an outward flux of
  Lamas establishing themselves in the United States and subsequently in western
  Europe.

- The second, its adaptability. Buddhism at its core is more minimal than a
  religion, less weighted. It is a way of life. A set of guidelines, a path to
  be walked on to satisfaction and happiness, with an interpretation of its
  destination. Political and social issues in the 20th century synergized with
  this adaptability to form many branches of Buddhism; to each his own path to
  happiness. Several minor branches such as feminist Buddhism and Gay Buddhism
  have been noted, springing up alongside the respective social movements.

# Post WW2

In the latter half of the 20th century, the west saw an exponential rise in
consumerism and a revaluation of faith, with mass stress caused by rapidly
modernizing work environemnts, led many to look for altered states of
consciousness to detach themselves from the dissatisfactory developments. This
gave rise to the psychedelic movement in the 70s, and over a larger period,
attracted people, especially those looking for more sober, spiritual
experiences, to Buddhist schools established by the immigrant influx from Asia.
