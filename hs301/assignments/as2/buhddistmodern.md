- Different interpretations and adaptations of Buddhist teachings to deal with
  modern day issues 
- Different adaptations of Buddhism for modern audiences: 

## Engaged Buddhism 
- Buddhism for social welfare / ecology etc. It engages actively yet
  nonviolently with the social, economic, political, social, and ecological
  problems of society. Draws on from the main root of buddhism to help people
  overcome their suffering. 

-  Developed in the 20th century across several buddhist asian countries. Eg:
   Plum Village tradition of Thich Nhat Than (Vietnam -> France),  Sarvodaya
   Shramadana (Sri Lanka), 14th Dalai Lama (Tibet -> Dharmashala) as well as by
   Western Masters (Bernie Glassman). 
-  Inspired by the crises in the 20th century (WW2, Cold War,  Vietnam War etc),
   ecological crises (eg Fishing in Thailand)
-  Influenced by some western ideas like psychology, economics etc. 
-  Development monks in Thailand, Ecology monks etc
-  Not true that Buddhism is very isolationist and inward driven. Bhikkus play
   role in society that was lost by colonialism. The Buddha gained enlightenment
   but also taught and helped those suffering. 

### Dukkha 
- Pleasure is transient. Existence leads to sorrow and misery. 
- Craving and ignorance lead to dukkha - VERY RELEVENT IN MODERN SOCIETY ALSO 

### Buddhist Method and Doctrine 
- No blind faith, look for experimental truths. 
- Noble Eight fold Path - Is this relevent and practical in modern times? 
- Compassion (Karuna- Characteristic of Bodhisattva) - caring about the
  suffering of others. Related to Metta - wishing for goodwill for others. 
- Meditate on Avaloletesvara to develop compassion 
- Doctrine of No-Self and interdependence require us to treat other life
  withrespect and avoid harming them
- Truth to be found in experience. 

 ### Compassion 
 - Universal compassionâ€”caring about the suffering of others without limitation
   by nationality, ideology race, or other dividing factor. Third Way in the
   Vietnam Way, nonviolent protests. You want to get peace instead of getting
   some ideological victory. It recognises no one as the enemy.
   Nonjudgementalism is very important. This includes avoiding morally judging
   people whom you are trying to stop. 
 - Retributive Justice as an ideal harms peace. Eg. Isarel Palestine conflict
   continuation. Compassion for all parties suffering is important 
 - Working for world peace requires inner peace. 
 - Caring for others is greater personal happiness 
 - Personal spiritual growth used to help you undertake social activities
   better. 
 - Compassion comes from no - self selflessness, understanding that there is no
   distinction between self and others. 
   ## Economics 
- Buddha proposed the Madhyapratipat - or the middle way. He did not endorse
  poverty. 
- Poverty is a terrible form of suffering, that should not be allowed to exist. 
- Engaged buddhism believes in humanistic socialism. This has led to a great
  amount of consumption that is bad for the world. People feel like their value
  is only dependent on the cost of the things they own. Dukkha leads to this
  desire that cannot be quenched. Focus should be on taking care of the
  interdependent needs (The Right Livelihood )
- Thailand monks preach against consumerism to people who have taken on huge
  debts. 
- You can interpret the 5th precept to avoid consumerism of things that are
  toxic to you. Unending growth is unsustainable. Desires are the root of dukkha
  and so feeding those desires will still lead to more dukkha. 
- Focus is on becoming something better. Based on annata, you are not who you
  are but what you can become. The focus therefore is on improving youself
  always. 
- Buddhist notion of interdependence is used to justify building interdependent
  communities with harmony. Focus is given on incorporating multicultural focus
  on the varioud ethnicities in Sarvoday. 
- Shared, communal meals etc. 
- 
## Ecology 
- Caring for the environment important par of engaged buddhism - Eg protesting
  against nuclear development and waste dumping in tibet. 
- Interdependence / Pratityasamuttapada is used to show how we are connected to
  ecology and the environment. Existence is a web of connectedness. 
- Buddhism seems the environemnt as having value to humans as well as intrinsic
  values thorugh annata. Animans are sentient beings. We should try and stop
  their suffering 
- Deep ecology - inspired by Spinoza, Gandhi and Buddhism. Let go of
  anthropomorphism 
- Mindfullness helps connect with nature, to realise annata. 
- Inspired rainforest action network in the USA by realizing that there is no
  separation between the rainforest and him. 
- Ability to come out of despair. Acknowledge that it is real, and participate
  in the world's pain. 
- Thailands ecology monks, focus on deforestation. Ordain trees in forests as
  monks to prevent people from cutting it down . 
- Don't treat corporates as evil, try to work with them.
