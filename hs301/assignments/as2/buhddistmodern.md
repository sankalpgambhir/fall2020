- Different interpretations and adaptations of Buddhist teachings to deal with modern day issues 
- Different adaptations of Buddhism for modern audiences: 

## Engaged Buddhism 
- Buddhism for social welfare / ecology etc. It engages actively yet nonviolently with the social,
economic, political, social, and ecological problems of society. Draws on from the main root of buddhism to help people overcome their suffering. 

-  Developed in the 20th century across several buddhist asian countries. Eg: Plum Village tradition of Thich Nhat Than (Vietnam -> France),  Sarvodaya Shramadana (Sri Lanka), 14th Dalai Lama (Tibet -> Dharmashala) as well as by Western Masters (Bernie Glassman). 
-  Inspired by the crises in the 20th century (WW2, Cold War,  Vietnam War etc), ecological crises (eg Fishing in Thailand)
-  Influenced by some western ideas like psychology, economics etc. 
-  Development monks in Thailand, Ecology monks etc
-  Not true that Buddhism is very isolationist and inward driven. Bhikkus play role in society that was lost by colonialism. The Buddha gained enlightenment but also taught and helped those suffering. 

### Dukkha 
- Pleasure is transient. Existence leads to sorrow and misery. 
- Craving and ignorance lead to dukkha - VERY RELEVENT IN MODERN SOCIETY ALSO 
  
### Buddhist Method and Doctrine 
- No blind faith, look for experimental truths. 
- Noble Eight fold Path - Is this relevent and practical in modern times? 
- Compassion (Karuna- Characteristic of Bodhisattva) - caring about the suffering of others. Related to Metta - wishing for goodwill for others. 
- Meditate on Avaloletesvara to develop compassion 
- Doctrine of No-Self and interdependence require us to treat other life withrespect and avoid harming them
- Truth to be found in experience. 
  
 ### Compassion 
 - Universal compassionâ€”caring about the suffering of others without limitation by nationality, ideology race, or other dividing factor. Third Way in the Vietnam Way, nonviolent protests. You want to get peace instead of getting some ideological victory. It recognises no one as the enemy. Nonjudgementalism is very important. This includes avoiding morally judging people whom you are trying to stop. 
 - Retributive Justice as an ideal harms peace. Eg. Isarel Palestine conflict continuation. Compassion for all parties suffering is important 
 - Working for world peace requires inner peace. 
 - Caring for others is greater personal happiness
