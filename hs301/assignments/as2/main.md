## Buddhism WHatever 

### History 

For centuries, Buddhism remained isolated to East Asia, and while branches of it
emerged, influenced by different philosophies, cultural influence would remain
limited till it did not escape its confines. Buddhism made contact with the
European Christian community in the 19th century, then dismissed by most
religious figures as an "idolatric produce of Indian pessimism". However, the
viewpoint did not remain unchallenged for long, as with the rise of Buddhist
depictions in literature brought the judgement to the hands of the common
people, with them suffering in the most brutal wars yet seen. Riding on the wind
of rising spiritualism, it established itself as a less radical, more rational
alternative to Christianity in most minds. 

At the same time, a rise in Darwinistic philosophy and a stronger belief in
science among people was loosening faith in Christianity, while many scholars
argued for Buddhism as a more consistent philosophy, encouraging reason and
observation more so than faith.

With expansion to the west, Buddhism would see synchronisation with several
cultural movements, branching and morphing to the needs of the students as much
as the teachers' wishes. Affected by issues such as WW2, the Cold War, the
ecological exploitation around the world, and merging with the thoughts of new
western masters such as Bernie Glassman.

Two possible reasons for its fiery spread can be speculated, its detachment from
the relatively isolated asian culture, and its adaptability, affecting people on
both societal and personal levels.


### Society 

The first, arising from the Dalai Lama's exit due to Tibet's political
situation, put Buddhism front and center on the world stage, giving many the
insight and opportunity needed to delve in it, coupled with an outward flux of
Lamas establishing themselves in the United States and subsequently in western
Europe.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the world saw an exponential rise in
consumerism and a revaluation of faith, with mass stress caused by rapidly
modernizing work environemnts, led many to look for altered states of
consciousness to detach themselves from the dissatisfactory developments. This
gave rise to the psychedelic movement in the 70s in the United States, and over
a larger period, attracted people, especially those looking for more sober,
spiritual experiences, to Buddhist schools established by the immigrant influx
from Asia.

Buddhism engages actively yet nonviolently with the social, economic, political,
social, and ecological problems of society. Drawing on from the main root of
Buddhism to help people overcome their suffering. 

```
-  Developed in the 20th century across several buddhist asian countries. Eg:
   Plum Village tradition of Thich Nhat Than (Vietnam -> France),  Sarvodaya
   Shramadana (Sri Lanka), 14th Dalai Lama (Tibet -> Dharmashala) as well as by
   Western Masters (Bernie Glassman). 
-  Inspired by the crises in the 20th century (WW2, Cold War,  Vietnam War etc),
   ecological crises (eg Fishing in Thailand)
-  Influenced by some western ideas like psychology, economics etc. 
-  Development monks in Thailand, Ecology monks etc
-  Not true that Buddhism is very isolationist and inward driven. Bhikkus play
   role in society that was lost by colonialism. The Buddha gained enlightenment
   but also taught and helped those suffering. 
```
The Buddhe proposed Madhyapratipat, the middle path, for the one and the many. A
consequence was an economy of moderation and interdependence, to help oneself
and others, to eliminate poverty, which in itself is a terrible form of
suffering, which makes one's self worth dependent only on the monetary value of
their possessions. By encouraging satisfaction of interdependent needs, Buddhism
promotes a serene and symbiotic way of life for the one and their society. The
5th precept may be understood as avoiding consumerism of things toxic to
oneself, and to focus on your own betterment. In recent times, with ever
increasing wealth gaps, Buddhism offers a path to a harmonious society free of
toxic segregation by perceived worth.

```
## Economics 
- Buddha proposed the Madhyapratipat - or the middle way. He did not endorse
  poverty. 
- Poverty is a terrible form of suffering, that should not be allowed to exist. 
- Engaged buddhism believes in humanistic socialism. This has led to a great
  amount of consumption that is bad for the world. People feel like their value
  is only dependent on the cost of the things they own. Dukkha leads to this
  desire that cannot be quenched. Focus should be on taking care of the
  interdependent needs (The Right Livelihood )
- Thailand monks preach against consumerism to people who have taken on huge
  debts. 
- You can interpret the 5th precept to avoid consumerism of things that are
  toxic to you. Unending growth is unsustainable. Desires are the root of dukkha
  and so feeding those desires will still lead to more dukkha. 
- Focus is on becoming something better. Based on annata, you are not who you
  are but what you can become. The focus therefore is on improving youself
  always. 
- Buddhist notion of interdependence is used to justify building interdependent
  communities with harmony. Focus is given on incorporating multicultural focus
  on the varioud ethnicities in Sarvoday. 
- Shared, communal meals etc. 
```
**TODO translate ecology**

```
## Ecology 
- Caring for the environment important par of engaged buddhism - Eg protesting
  against nuclear development and waste dumping in tibet. 
- Interdependence / Pratityasamuttapada is used to show how we are connected to
  ecology and the environment. Existence is a web of connectedness. 
- Buddhism seems the environemnt as having value to humans as well as intrinsic
  values thorugh annata. Animans are sentient beings. We should try and stop
  their suffering 
- Deep ecology - inspired by Spinoza, Gandhi and Buddhism. Let go of
  anthropomorphism 
- Mindfullness helps connect with nature, to realise annata. 
- Inspired rainforest action network in the USA by realizing that there is no
  separation between the rainforest and him. 
- Ability to come out of despair. Acknowledge that it is real, and participate
  in the world's pain. 
- Thailands ecology monks, focus on deforestation. Ordain trees in forests as
  monks to prevent people from cutting it down . 
- Don't treat corporates as evil, try to work with them. 
```

### Personal 

The second, its adaptability. Buddhism at its core is more minimal than a
religion, less weighted. It is a way of life. A set of guidelines, a path to
be walked on to satisfaction and happiness, with an interpretation of its
destination. Political and social issues in the 20th century synergized with
this adaptability to form many branches of Buddhism; to each his own path to
happiness. Several minor branches such as feminist Buddhism and Gay Buddhism
have been noted, springing up alongside the respective social movements.
