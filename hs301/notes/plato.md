## Philosophical Problem

The relationship between epistemology, philosophy, and 
ethics. He tried to integrate metaphysics, epistemology, 
and ethics systematically. He draws his ideas from many 
philosophers and tries to give a clear coherent picture.

## Theory of Ideas

- Knowledge is eternal, changeless (Parmenides)
- Sense experiences vary, appearances change
- True, conceptual knowledge can be comprehended through reason.

Conceptual thinking based on:

- clarity
- precision
- synthesis

For sophists, opinion and true knowledge was the same, 
and it varied a lot, so common people were quite confused 
by it. Plato tries to show a distinction between 
appearances, opinions and true knowledge, the reality.

He uses the Dialectical method.

### Dialectical Method

> *Art of investigating truth or opinions*

Generalize and conceptually classify experiences and 
objects. Context-free classification, path to true 
knowledge. *Isomorphism classes of objects and ideas.* 
Can a 'concept' be an object of thought?

Plato raises the idea of ***universals***. Particulars 
are their instances, copies. Unlike particulars, 
universals are always free of temporal natures. Their 
instances change with time and context, but retain their 
nature.

In particular, Plato was at odds with his predecessor Parmenides

- An idea is not a thought - Parmenides
  - It may be the object of a though - Plato
- There is only one idea - Parmenides
  - There are multiple nidivisible ideas - Plato
- Ideas are not known to us, human knowledge is not absolute - Parmenides 
  - Ideas can be comprehended using 
  reason, soul is akin to these ideas - Plato

These points from Plato emphasize the Dialectical method 
and its place in philosophy.


## Metaphysics

We may classify objects into universals, but we cannot 
understand them till we try to understand the universals. 
Classification is not knowledge, understanding, 
reasoning, is.

Having an opinion of *goodness* is possible by seeing several good 
actions, but it grants no real understanding of *what* goodness is. It 
only comes through deep contemplation of the idea and its attached 
experiences. Experiences merely complement and refine the understanding 
of *goodness* that already existed obscurely and implicitly in the 
soul. This is what Plato wished to focus on.

Man is therefore, the measure of all that is true, just, or good, for 
the essence of those ideas lies dormant in man's soul, implicit as it 
may be. Through experiences one reawakens this dormant truth.

## Epistemology

> *Change is the only object of permanence.*\

Heraclitus and others' ideas tell us that all things 
change. This change validates comparisons, relative 
knowledge, and contexts. These experiences refine our 
knowledge of the universe and of universals. Socrates 
believed that judgement can be better in having better 
consequences, but we are the judges of what better is. He 
argued that perfection is merely pragmatic.

Plato's ideas separate what can be gained via the senses 
and via the mind. The senses may differentiate hard and 
soft, but only the mind determines that they exist and 
they are contraries. Only the mind can reach existence, 
and is fundamentally different from the experieces 
reached by the bodily senses.

Plato's ideas on knowledge are succintly described in 4 tiers from the 
bottom:

- Conjecture 
  - That which offers a distorted, probable picture based on 
    experience. It interacts only with images and shadows of the truth. 
    However Plato considers this low grade of cognition as offering 
    some clue of the true form of the object it reflects.
- Belief 
  - That which is based on sensory experience. It pertains to 
    material objects such as trees, rivers, handicraft, etc. Although 
    more reliable than conjecture, it is very much only probable 
    knowledge, based on the fleeting representation that is the sensory 
    experience.
- Discursive Intellect 
  - That which is based on deductive reasoning
    from definitions and assumptions. It concerns itself with 
    hypothetical existences such as numbers, shapes, etc. It may be 
    complemented by sensuous imagery, but it only symbolically assists 
    the deduction, such as geometrical figures. This type of knowledge 
    is not necessarily based on real experiences.
- Rational Insight 
  - That which is based on the dialectical. It relies 
    on categorical first principles, introspection, and understanding 
    of objects and how they relate to the *Good*.


## Psychology and Ethics

Relation between agents and values. Psychology attempts 
to determines why an agent performs an action, and ethics 
atempt to determine the value behind it. Just as Plato's 
metaphysics is deeply intertwined with his theory of 
knowledge, we find it here as well. Plato believes the 
worth of human actions, lives, and institutions is based 
on deeper questions about the nature of the world and man 
himself.

### Agency

The soul is the charioteer to the chariot that is the 
body, with the horses representing the senses. The horses 
may sometimes be strong enough to lead the charioteer 
astray often, the same way the soul is driven by sensual 
experiences. Plato believes that the soul exists before, 
and exists independently of the physical body, the 
interaction between the two then producing a tripartite 
relationship:

- Reason
  - The rational part of the soul, driven by pure reason.
- Spirit
  - Irrational part of the soul, driven by nobler impulses -- anger, ambition, love of power
- Appetite
  - Part of the soul driven completely by lower impulses and passions. Controlled by little reason.

This partition forms an important part of Plato's idea of 
psychology. He presents actions of an agent as being 
derived of these three parts, as three distinct types. 
Rational action driven by reason, and irrational action, 
driven either by will and the spirit, or completely 
lacking reason, driven by appetite.

Understanding good action forms a central part of Plato's 
philosophy. He believed that the body is an impediment, 
and that the soul must free itself from the body to gain 
true knowledge. Every bit of knowledge one collects, 
thinks about, is reminiscence of what the soul has lost, 
and reawakens it, bit by bit. The reawakening is 
fundamental to understanding good actions and evaluating 
choices presented to oneself, to make rational decisions.

Virtues one develops via understanding and gaining 
knowledge allows one to exercise self-control and perform 
just actions. They lead one to become happy.
