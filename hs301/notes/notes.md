## Introduction

What is philosophy? Philosophy is a *humanistic* discipline. Intended to investigate reality and understand how we fit into it.

Philosophy investigates:

- knowledge,
- the human mind,
- the nature of reality,
- values, and
- relationships.

Philosophy is a form of **self-reflective, critical, and rational** inquiry.
It presents a picture of the world and/or a set of values, even pictures about the nature of philosophy and the need to study it.
Thinking about basic ideas and explaining things around yourself forms your own picture of it.

> "An apple falling leads to shaking the tree."

Basic ideas are born out of observation and lead to experimentation.

Experimentation leads to more complex ideas, and eventually, the picture of the world finds its feet as a discipline, and often separates from philosophy, such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, and psychology.
