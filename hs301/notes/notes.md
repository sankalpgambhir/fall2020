## Introduction

> "Philosophy is not an activity by itself... ofcourse it is."\
> \- Ranjan Kumar Panda

What is philosophy? Philosophy is a *humanistic* discipline. Intended to investigate reality and understand how we fit into it.

Philosophy investigates:

- knowledge,
- the human mind,
- the nature of reality,
- values, and
- relationships.

Philosophy is a form of **self-reflective, critical, and rational** inquiry.
It presents a picture of the world and/or a set of values, even pictures about the nature of philosophy and the need to study it.
Thinking about basic ideas and explaining things around yourself forms your own picture of it.

> "An apple falling leads to shaking the tree."

Basic ideas are born out of observation and lead to experimentation.

Experimentation leads to more complex ideas, and eventually, the picture of the world finds its feet as a discipline, and often separates from philosophy, such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, and psychology.

## Origins

Philosophy arose classically with religious foundations, as a search for *wisdom*, from pressing motivation or some deeply felt beliefs.

It originated in Greece and India

### Classical Greek Philosophy

***TBC***

### Classical Indian Philosophy

Arose as discussion between schools of Hinduism as well as Buddhism, as a battle for *intellectual supremacy*, an argument to prove *their* view of the world was correct.

## Main Ideas

Philosophy presents three main questions:

- What really exists?

  - What is being? What is existence?
  - Does existence/life have a meaning?
  - Is death the end?

- Whether we can know anything
- Whether anything is really right or wrong

To answer these questions, several schools of philosophy developed:

- Humanist

  - ***TBC***

- Realist

## Ways of thinking

- Speculative
  - Philosophy began with speculation
  - Advances with intuitive insights beyond what is observed
  - Highlights power of thought and imagination in deducing underlying principles
- Imaginative / Creative
  - Spirit of discovery / invention
  - Leads to new questions and observations
  - Tagore - Scientific truths can only be reached through logic, while universal truths may not, they are *human*.
- Reflective / Critical / Meditative
  - Objective analysis of thoughts
  - Skillful application of concepts
  - Synthesis of Ideas *(imaginative mix?)*
  - Assesses:
    - Accuracy
    - Consistency
    - Relevance
- Argumentative
  - Arguments are a foundation of philosophy
  - Experiment with thoughts
  - Regulated by laws of logic
  - Deduce another set of thoughts from one set
- Liberal / Inclusive
  - Philosophy needs being open minded
  - Accepting new thoughts and ideas as a path to the future
  - Lack leads to *Philosophical Blindness*
  - Demands self-scrutiny to eliminate prejudices

## Branches of Philosophy

### Metaphysics

> *What is the fundamental nature of the universe?*

- Fundamental work by Aristotle
- Shunned during the Rennaisance \- 'philosophical nonsense'
- Remains relevant in the context of disciplinary integration, application of philosophical ideas as a whole

### Epistemology

> *What is knowledge? How can we 'know'?*

- Knowledge \- *justified beliefs*
- Based on **reason** and **experiences**
  - Rationalism, and
  - Empiricism

Epistemology finds roots in muses about the nature of thought and knowledge in classical philosophies:

- **Greek** \
  Pyrrho - Pyrrhonism (skepticism) \
  Doubting is a form of knowing. True knowledge is impossible.
- **Indian** \
  Knowledge is based on fundamental principles based on our forms of interaction with the universe, each complementing the others:
  - *Pratyaksha* \- Perception\
    Sensory Perception, only as reliable as our senses.
  - *Anumana* \- Inference\
    Deduction, logical arguments based on perception.
  - *Upmana* \- Comparison\
    ***Not sure tbh***
  - *Shabda* \- Testimony\
    Word of mouth, relies on trust in speaker.

### Logic

> *How to develop a system of arguments?*

- Justification for arguments
- A method of proof

Arguments must be structured and follow logical deduction rules, they should be scientific in nature.

#### Structure of Arguments

- Premise\
  A *false or true* statement about the world. Arguments may be drawn from either premise, the proof technique is independent of the nature of premise. If the premise holds true and the deductions are sound, the conclusion will hold true as well.
- Deduction/Proof Method\
  Each sentence should draw from the previous based on some sound logical rules.
- Conclusion\
  Any reduction of the premise by use of the proof rules. May be false or true depending on the nature of the premise. If proof rules are not sound, *a false conclusion can be derived from a true premise.*

#### Types of Arguments

- *Deductive* Arguments
  - Introduced by Aristotle
- *Inductive* Arguments
  - Introduced by Francis Bacon
