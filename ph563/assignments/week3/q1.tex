    $\cyclic_{4v}$ is an abelian group. So, all its irreps are one-dimensional
    and its wavefunctions non-degenerate.

    \questionpart \textbf{False.}\\
    The dimension of the tensor product of two representations is the product
    of their individual dimensions, not their sum.

    \questionpart \textbf{False.}\\
    We need to look at the transition amplitude $\bra{10} e\hat Y \ket{00}$ to check if the 
    transition is forbidden. The unit irrep $A_1$ is present in the decomposition of the 
    tensor product of irreps for this amplitude, so it will evaluate to a non-zero quantity.
