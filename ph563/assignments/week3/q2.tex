    \questionpart \textbf{iv. $\chi_{B_2}$}\\
    The character for a tensor product of representations is the product of
    individual characters, which in this case, clearly from the character table
    is $\chi_{B_2}$

    \questionpart \textbf{iii. 6-dimensional vector space}\\
    The dimension of the tensor product of two representations is the product
    of their individual dimensions.
