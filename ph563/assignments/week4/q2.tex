    \questionpart \textbf{iii. 9}\\
    The number of normal modes will be $2N$, and subtracting the 2 modes
    corresponding to translation and 1 of the rotation of the COM, we get $2N -
    3$, which in our case, $N = 6$ is 9.

    \questionpart \textbf{iii. $B_1$}\\
    The normal coordinate corresponding to this mode is $x + y$, which
    corresponds to an eigenvector of $P_{B_1} - T_x$, and hence corresponds to
    the $B_1$ irreducible. 

    \questionpart \textbf{none. $a = 2, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0$}\\
    We calculate the characters of the 4 conjugacy classes in the reducible
    representation, to get $\{3, 1, 1, 1\}$. Combined with the orthogonality
    relations, this gives us $\Gamma = 2A_1 \oplus B_1$.
