    The symmetric potential gives rise to a Hamiltonian with
    inversion symmetry about origin. The solutions 'inherit' 
    this symmetry, being either even or odd, with position
    expectation 0.

    Due to the construction of the coset (i.e. $G \cdot a$), every 
    element of the group is included in atleast one coset, by action
    on the identity. Thus, the union of all cosets of a group forms 
    the entire group.

    The exponential map $\exp(x)$ maps $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^+$
    homomorphically, and inversely, the natural logarithm maps $\mathbb{R}^+$
    to $\mathbb{R}$. The composition gives the identity morphisms
    in either direction.

    A 2-cycle and a 4-cycle can be written as a composition of 
    1 and 3 transpositions respectively, for a total of 4, which is 
    even. Hence, the elements do belong to $\mathfrak{U} (6)$.
